# Binary number converter

## Week 2 Assignment 3_3 - NECC
## Professor Ethel Schuster
## Student Patricia Antlitz

### This program takes user input using built-in function scanf from the stdio library. uses math library

##### User interactions:

- Asks the user for a binary number.

This program takes a binary number and converts to decimal

I did have some difficulties to make the math work on this one. I did not understand the instructions: "Take each number
and divide or take the modulo", was the numbers supposed to be in an array?
I ended up using a for loop since I think it is better, and implemented the math library for the usage of 'pow' for the exponencial
calculation
